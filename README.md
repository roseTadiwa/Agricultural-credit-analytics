## Project Components
The repository includes the following documents:

1. **Code**: Scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and predictive modeling.
2. **Dataset**: Agricultural yield data used for the analysis.
3. **Insights Report**: A report summarizing findings and implications.


## Getting Started
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agricultural-data-analysis.git
